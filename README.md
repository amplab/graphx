# GraphX Branch of Spark

This is experimental code for the Apache spark project.

Lightning-Fast Cluster Computing - <http://spark.incubator.apache.org/>


## Online Documentation

You can find the latest Spark documentation, including a programming
guide, on the project webpage at <http://spark.incubator.apache.org/documentation.html>.
This README file only contains basic setup instructions.


## Building

Spark requires Scala 2.9.3 (Scala 2.10 is not yet supported). The project is
built using Simple Build Tool (SBT), which is packaged with it. To build
Spark and its example programs, run:

    sbt/sbt assembly

Once you've built Spark, the easiest way to start using it is the shell:

    ./spark-shell

Or, for the Python API, the Python shell (`./pyspark`).

Spark also comes with several sample programs in the `examples` directory.
To run one of them, use `./run-example <class> <params>`. For example:

    ./run-example org.apache.spark.examples.SparkLR local[2]

will run the Logistic Regression example locally on 2 CPUs.

Each of the example programs prints usage help if no params are given.

All of the Spark samples take a `<master>` parameter that is the cluster URL
to connect to. This can be a mesos:// or spark:// URL, or "local" to run
locally with one thread, or "local[N]" to run locally with N threads.


## A Note About Hadoop Versions

Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
You can change the version by setting the `SPARK_HADOOP_VERSION` environment
when building Spark.

For Apache Hadoop versions 1.x, Cloudera CDH MRv1, and other Hadoop
versions without YARN, use:

    # Apache Hadoop 1.2.1
    $ SPARK_HADOOP_VERSION=1.2.1 sbt/sbt assembly

    # Cloudera CDH 4.2.0 with MapReduce v1
    $ SPARK_HADOOP_VERSION=2.0.0-mr1-cdh4.2.0 sbt/sbt assembly

For Apache Hadoop 2.x, 0.23.x, Cloudera CDH MRv2, and other Hadoop versions
with YARN, also set `SPARK_YARN=true`:

    # Apache Hadoop 2.0.5-alpha
    $ SPARK_HADOOP_VERSION=2.0.5-alpha SPARK_YARN=true sbt/sbt assembly

    # Cloudera CDH 4.2.0 with MapReduce v2
    $ SPARK_HADOOP_VERSION=2.0.0-cdh4.2.0 SPARK_YARN=true sbt/sbt assembly

For convenience, these variables may also be set through the `conf/spark-env.sh` file
described below.

When developing a Spark application, specify the Hadoop version by adding the
"hadoop-client" artifact to your project's dependencies. For example, if you're
using Hadoop 1.0.1 and build your application using SBT, add this entry to
`libraryDependencies`:

    "org.apache.hadoop" % "hadoop-client" % "1.2.1"

If your project is built with Maven, add this to your POM file's `<dependencies>` section:

    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.apache.hadoop</groupId>
      <artifactId>hadoop-client</artifactId>
      <version>1.2.1</version>
    </dependency>


## Configuration

Please refer to the [Configuration guide](http://spark.incubator.apache.org/docs/latest/configuration.html)
in the online documentation for an overview on how to configure Spark.


## Apache Incubator Notice

Apache Spark is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software
Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Incubator. Incubation is required of
all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the
infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in
a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation status
is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code,
it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
