 * Low-level task scheduler interface, implemented by both ClusterScheduler and LocalScheduler.

 * These schedulers get sets of tasks submitted to them from the DAGScheduler for each stage,
 * and are responsible for sending the tasks to the cluster, running them, retrying if there
 * are failures, and mitigating stragglers. They return events to the DAGScheduler.
