/**
 *  Produces a count of events received from Flume.
 *
 *  This should be used in conjunction with an AvroSink in Flume. It will start
 *  an Avro server on at the request host:port address and listen for requests.
 *  Your Flume AvroSink should be pointed to this address.
 *
 *  Usage: FlumeEventCount <master> <host> <port>
 *
 *    <master> is a Spark master URL
 *    <host> is the host the Flume receiver will be started on - a receiver
 *           creates a server and listens for flume events.
 *    <port> is the port the Flume receiver will listen on.
