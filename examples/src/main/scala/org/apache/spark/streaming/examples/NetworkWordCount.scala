/**
 * Counts words in UTF8 encoded, '\n' delimited text received from the network every second.
 * Usage: NetworkWordCount <master> <hostname> <port>
 *   <master> is the Spark master URL. In local mode, <master> should be 'local[n]' with n > 1.
 *   <hostname> and <port> describe the TCP server that Spark Streaming would connect to receive data.
 *
 * To run this on your local machine, you need to first run a Netcat server
 *    `$ nc -lk 9999`
 * and then run the example
 *    `$ ./bin/run-example org.apache.spark.streaming.examples.NetworkWordCount local[2] localhost 9999`
