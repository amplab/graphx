 * A receiver trait to be mixed in with your Actor to gain access to

 * @example {{{
 * 	class MyActor extends Actor with Receiver{
 * 		def receive {
 * 			case anything :String ⇒ pushBlock(anything)
 * 		}
 *  }
 *  //Can be plugged in actorStream as follows

 * @note An important point to note:
 *       Since Actor may exist outside the spark framework, It is thus user's responsibility
 *       to ensure the type safety, i.e parametrized type of push block and InputDStream
 *       should be same.
